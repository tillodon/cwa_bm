# Epic 2: Test Result Reporting & Warning System

## Epic Goal

Enable secure, anonymous reporting of positive COVID-19 test results and automated warning distribution to potentially exposed users while maintaining complete user anonymity.

## Epic Description

**System Context:**
- Corona-Warn-App with established contact tracing foundation
- Technology stack: Secure backend APIs, Laboratory Information Systems integration
- Integration points: Lab systems, Healthcare providers, Government health databases

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being built:** Secure test result verification and anonymous warning distribution system
- **How it works:** Authorized labs/healthcare providers verify positive results, users can voluntarily trigger anonymous warnings
- **Success criteria:**
  - Secure verification of test results from authorized sources
  - Anonymous warning distribution to exposed contacts
  - User control over warning publication

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Lab Integration & Test Verification
   - Integrate with Laboratory Information Systems for secure test result transmission
   - Implement verification of authorized healthcare providers
   - Create secure API for test result confirmation

2. **Story 2:** Anonymous Warning Publication
   - Enable users to voluntarily publish anonymous exposure keys after positive test
   - Implement secure key distribution to backend servers
   - Ensure complete anonymity in warning process

3. **Story 3:** Exposure Warning Reception
   - Download and process published exposure keys from backend
   - Match against local encounter history
   - Generate appropriate risk notifications for users

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Integration with existing German laboratory systems
- [ ] Secure communication protocols (TLS, certificate pinning)
- [ ] Compliance with medical data protection regulations
- [ ] Support for various test types and result formats

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** False positive reports or system abuse
- **Mitigation:** Multi-level verification through authorized healthcare providers only
- **Rollback Plan:** Temporarily disable test result submission while maintaining exposure detection

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Secure integration with at least 3 major German laboratory systems
- [ ] Anonymous warning system tested with simulated positive cases
- [ ] Medical data protection compliance verified
- [ ] User consent and control mechanisms fully functional
- [ ] Performance testing with high-volume warning distribution
