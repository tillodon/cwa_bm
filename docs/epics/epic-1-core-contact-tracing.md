# Epic 1: Core Contact Tracing System

## Epic Goal

Implement the foundational contact tracing functionality using Apple/Google Exposure Notification API to detect, log, and assess COVID-19 exposure risks through anonymous Bluetooth encounters.

## Epic Description

**System Context:**
- New Corona-Warn-App for COVID-19 contact tracing in Germany
- Technology stack: iOS/Android native apps, Apple/Google Exposure Notification API
- Integration points: Apple/Google APIs, Backend infrastructure for key distribution

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being built:** Core anonymous contact tracing system using Bluetooth Low Energy
- **How it works:** Decentralized approach with local data storage and anonymous key exchange
- **Success criteria:** 
  - Anonymous Bluetooth encounter detection with >90% accuracy
  - Risk calculation algorithm based on proximity and duration
  - Privacy-compliant data handling (no personal data stored)

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Bluetooth Encounter Detection
   - Implement Apple/Google Exposure Notification API integration
   - Enable anonymous encounter logging with rotating pseudonymous IDs
   - Ensure minimal battery and data usage

2. **Story 2:** Risk Assessment Algorithm  
   - Develop risk calculation based on encounter duration and proximity
   - Implement configurable risk thresholds
   - Create notification system for high-risk encounters

3. **Story 3:** Privacy & Data Protection
   - Implement decentralized data storage on user devices
   - Ensure no personal data, IP addresses, or location data collection
   - Enable data deletion and user consent management

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Compliant with Apple/Google Exposure Notification API specifications
- [ ] GDPR/DSGVO compliant data handling
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Minimal impact on device performance and battery life

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Privacy concerns reducing user adoption
- **Mitigation:** Transparent open-source code, clear privacy explanations, decentralized architecture
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable exposure notifications while maintaining app functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Exposure notification API successfully integrated on both platforms
- [ ] Risk assessment algorithm validated with health authorities
- [ ] Privacy compliance verified through external audit
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (battery, data, processing)
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed with privacy-focused users
