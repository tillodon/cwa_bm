# Corona-Warn-App User Stories

This directory contains detailed user stories for the Corona-Warn-App development project.

## Epic 1: Core Contact Tracing System

The following user stories implement the foundational contact tracing functionality:

### [Story 1.1: Bluetooth Encounter Detection](./1.1.bluetooth-encounter-detection.md)
**Status:** Draft  
**As a** Corona-Warn-App user, **I want** the app to automatically detect and log anonymous Bluetooth encounters with other app users, **so that** I can be notified if I've been exposed to COVID-19 without compromising my privacy.

**Key Features:**
- Apple/Google Exposure Notification API integration
- Anonymous encounter logging with rotating IDs
- Battery and performance optimization
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)

### [Story 1.2: Risk Assessment Algorithm](./1.2.risk-assessment-algorithm.md)
**Status:** Draft  
**As a** Corona-Warn-App user, **I want** the app to calculate my COVID-19 exposure risk based on my encounter history, **so that** I receive accurate, timely warnings when I've had high-risk contact with infected individuals.

**Key Features:**
- RKI-approved epidemiological risk model
- Configurable risk thresholds (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Intelligent notification system
- Real-time risk assessment updates

### [Story 1.3: Privacy & Data Protection](./1.3.privacy-data-protection.md)
**Status:** Draft  
**As a** Corona-Warn-App user, **I want** complete control over my privacy with transparent, decentralized data handling, **so that** I can trust the app with my health data while maintaining my anonymity and personal privacy.

**Key Features:**
- Decentralized data architecture (no server-side storage)
- Anonymous identity system with rotating pseudonymous IDs
- User consent and control mechanisms
- GDPR/DSGVO compliance and open source transparency

## Development Sequence

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. **Story 1.1** - Foundation: Bluetooth encounter detection and API integration
2. **Story 1.3** - Privacy: Implement privacy controls and data protection
3. **Story 1.2** - Intelligence: Add risk assessment and notification system

## Story Relationships

```
Story 1.1 (Bluetooth Detection)
    ↓ (provides encounter data)
Story 1.3 (Privacy Protection)
    ↓ (ensures secure processing)
Story 1.2 (Risk Assessment)
    ↓ (generates risk notifications)
```

## Technical Dependencies

- **Apple/Google Exposure Notification API** (required for Stories 1.1 & 1.3)
- **RKI Epidemiological Guidelines** (required for Story 1.2)
- **Local Database Architecture** (shared across all stories)
- **Cryptographic Implementation** (critical for Story 1.3)

## Acceptance Testing

Each story includes comprehensive acceptance criteria covering:
- Functional requirements with measurable success metrics
- Technical performance benchmarks
- Privacy and security compliance verification
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- User experience validation

**Next Steps:** These stories are ready for development team assignment and sprint planning. Each story can be completed independently but should be integrated in the recommended sequence for optimal testing and validation.
